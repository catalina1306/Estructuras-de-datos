# Estructuras-de-datos
This repository documents my learning journey in C++ and Data Structures, following a study roadmap inspired by learncpp.com (I highly recommend this site if you are learning C++ from scratch ;) ).

The implementations developed focus on best practices, the use of modern C++, basic complexity analysis, and gaining a deep understanding of the language's internal mechanisms.

For any feedback or suggestions, you can reach me at my email: catalina.cepeda@ug.uchile.cl. I'm learning, so please be kind!

# Implemented Data Structures

- `Stack.hpp`: Implements a generic stack using a dynamic array. Supports push, pop, peek, dynamic resizing, and visual display.
- `dvector.hpp`: Implements a generic dynamic vector (similar to std::vector) with push_back, pop_back, move semantics, and boundary-checked access.

# Future Data Structures

As I continue my learning journey, I plan to implement the following data structures:

- **Queue**: A generic queue using a dynamic array or linked list, implementing FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior, with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Linked List**: Single and doubly linked lists to understand node-based structures and pointer manipulation.
- **Binary Heap**: A priority queue implementation to explore tree-based structures and heap operations.
- **Balanced Trees**: AVL or Red-Black trees to practice self-balancing trees and efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
- **HashMap**: A simple hash table implementation with collision handling, for efficient key-value storage and retrieval.
- **Advanced Vectors / Compact Structures**: Learning about memory-efficient data layouts and optimizations inspired by research such as Gonzalo Navarro's book.
