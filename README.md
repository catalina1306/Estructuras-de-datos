# Estructuras-de-datos
This repository documents my learning journey in C++ and Data Structures, following a study roadmap inspired by learncpp.com (I highly recommend this site if you are learning C++ from scratch ;) ).

The implementations developed focus on best practices, the use of modern C++, basic complexity analysis, and gaining a deep understanding of the language's internal mechanisms.

For any feedback or suggestions, you can reach me at my email: catalina.cepeda@ug.uchile.cl. I'm learning, so please be kind!
